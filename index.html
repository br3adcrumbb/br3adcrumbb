      <h2 style="color: pink">Why These Are My Favorite Animals üêí</h2>
      <p class = "mov2">
        These are my favorite Animals because they are all <em>diverse</em> and <em>appealing</em>
        in their own ways
      </p>
      <ol style="color: purple">
        <li>Orangutans</li>

        />

        
        <p class = "mov2">
          Orangutans are slightly orange which makes their name <strong>misleading.</strong> Most
          Orangutans are very round and fat, If you see a skinny Orangutan then
          that Orangutan Is malnutrisionized.

        />

        <p class = "mov2">
          Bears are very large and vary in colors depending on the terrain they
          are in. Despite being maybe <em>dangerous</em> and <em>deadly</em> we can only admire
          them from afar.

        <p class = "mov2">
          Hamsters are also very <em>round</em> and vary in colors, <strong>There is a pattern you can see in my favorite animals.</strong>
